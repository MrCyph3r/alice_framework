# Challenge Framework - POC

This project will be the base framework for a pentesting challenge and so it is intentionally vulnerable.

The purpose of this code is to show how some vulnerabilities works.


# About application/ folder

This folder contains a little (and useless) application used to test the various componets of the framework.
